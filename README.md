# Arduino Creator
Final project of the Distributed Systems for IoT subject from Internet of Things university master's degree: https://masteriot.etsist.upm.es

This project helps the user to program in arduino, using images of the different devices, writing their attributes and relating them with arrows, instead of having to write the program.
